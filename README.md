# CarBuyer

Tech stack :
  - Java
  - Spring Boot (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security)
  - Thymeleaf
  - HTML and CSS (mostly Bootstrap)
  - MySQL database
  - Hibernate


This project focuses mostly on using Spring Boot in a real life scenario.
CarBuyer is a simple car buying site, with functionalities like :
  - main page consists of offers added by authenticated users, each offer can be edited and deleted by owner.
  - registration and login 
  - search bar 


I am mostly proud of implementig authentication. It was my first time using Spring Security, so I am glad it works. ( I was using websecurityconfigureradapter and it deprecated shortly after I finished the project tho).
